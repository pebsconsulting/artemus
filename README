Intro
-----

Artemus is a template toolkit. It filters text files, parsing, compiling
and executing code surrounded by special marks (leaving the rest
untouched) and concatenating everything as output. Its main purpose is
to filter HTML files, but it can be used for any scripting need related
to text filtering and substitution.
